# OWASP Top 10 Security Risks

The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.

## 1. Broken Access Control
**Description:** Failures in access control allow unauthorized users to access restricted resources or perform unauthorized actions.
- **Attack Types:** URL Manipulation, Forced Browsing, Method Tampering
- **Tools:** [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/), [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp), [Wfuzz](https://github.com/xmendez/wfuzz)

## 2. Cryptographic Failures
**Description:** Involves improper implementation of cryptographic protocols that can lead to data breaches.
- **Attack Types:** Man-in-the-Middle (MitM), Padding Oracle Attacks, Weak Encryption
- **Tools:** [TestSSLServer](https://testssl.sh/), [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/), [Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/)

## 3. Injection
**Description:** Occurs when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query, leading to unintended execution of commands.
- **Attack Types:** SQL Injection, Command Injection, LDAP Injection
- **Tools:** [SQLMap](http://sqlmap.org/), [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/), [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp)

## 4. Insecure Design
**Description:** Involves inherent security flaws in the design of software systems, which fail to enforce necessary security controls.
- **Attack Types:** Threat Modeling Errors, Design Pattern Issues
- **Tools:** [Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/sdl/threatmodeling), [OWASP Threat Dragon](https://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon/)

## 5. Security Misconfiguration
**Description:** Default configurations, incomplete setups, or overly verbose error messages that provide too much information can lead to vulnerabilities.
- **Attack Types:** Default Accounts, Unpatched Systems
- **Tools:** [Nikto](https://cirt.net/Nikto2), [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus), [OpenVAS](https://www.openvas.org/)

## 6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components
**Description:** Using components with known vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers.
- **Attack Types:** Exploitation of Unpatched Software
- **Tools:** [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot), [Retire.js](https://retirejs.github.io/retire.js/), [OWASP Dependency-Check](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/)

## 7. Identification and Authentication Failures
**Description:** Flaws in the authentication process can allow attackers to assume other users' identities.
- **Attack Types:** Brute Force Attacks, Credential Stuffing
- **Tools:** [Hydra](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra), [John the Ripper](https://www.openwall.com/john/)

## 8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
**Description:** This includes issues like insecure software updates and critical data without integrity checks.
- **Attack Types:** Supply Chain Attacks, Code Injection
- **Tools:** [OWASP Dependency-Track](https://dependencytrack.org/), [Tripwire](https://www.tripwire.com/)

## 9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
**Description:** Lack of proper logging and monitoring can delay the detection of breaches.
- **Attack Types:** Evasion of Security Controls
- **Tools:** [ELK Stack](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack), [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/), [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/)

## 10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Description:** This occurs when an attacker can trick the server into making requests to an unintended destination.
- **Attack Types:** Blind SSRF
- **Tools:** [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp), [SSRFmap](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/SSRFmap)
